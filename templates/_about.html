  Here you can store and organize your LSDj tracks. After uploading a save file
  (SRAM) from your Game Boy emulator or flash cart, each LSDj track is
  extracted and stored in version control. You can go back later and see each
  version, compile sets/albums/playlist out of different tracks, and share your
  tracks with others.

  Chipmusic thrives in the open, and musicians thrive when they have good tools.
